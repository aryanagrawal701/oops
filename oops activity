Ans 1. The purpose of the constructor in pasenegr class is to give the passenger details like name,age and ticket no.
        In other words it is used to initalizen passenger objects in new atribytes.
ANS2. WE use displaydetails() for output of passengers details like name, age,and ticket no. in our passenger class .
ANS3.  If we didnt use contrurctor we have to give manully values of passenger details like name , age ticket no. in our code .
